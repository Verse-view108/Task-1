# Task-1 - Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface
Cybersecurity Basics (CIA Triad)

Confidentiality → Keep data secret (e.g., bank details, private messages)
Integrity → Keep data unchanged (no tampering with transfers or posts)
Availability → Keep systems up (no DDoS or ransomware blocking access)

Main Types of Attackers

-Script kiddies (noobs with ready tools)
-Insiders (employees/contractors gone rogue)
-Hacktivists (cause-driven protests)
-Ethical hackers (government-backed, very advanced)

Common Attack Surfaces
Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, networks, cloud infrastructure
OWASP Top 10:2025 (quick recap – the biggest web risks)

-Broken Access Control
-Security Misconfiguration
-Software Supply Chain Failures
-Cryptographic Failures
-Injection
-Insecure Design
-Identification & Authentication Failures
-Software and Data Integrity Failures
-Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
-Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

Data Flow & Attack Points
User → App → Network/Server → Database → back
Attacks can hit any step: phishing at user end, injection/API abuse in middle, misconfigs/ransomware at server/database.
In one line:
Cybersecurity protects privacy, accuracy, and uptime of our daily apps (email, WhatsApp, banking) against all kinds of attackers exploiting weak spots in code, config, design, and the whole data journey. OWASP Top 10 shows where most web attacks start today.
